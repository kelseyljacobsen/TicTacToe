Chalkboard Tic-Tac-Toe, my first project as a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, is a web version of the classic two-player paper and pencil game. It must be played on two screens/browsers simultaneously, so find a friend and begin playing! 

The game was built with HTML5, CSS3, CSS animations, AngularJS, and Firebase.
